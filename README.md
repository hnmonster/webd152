<p><h1><center>Iced Banana Latte</center></h1></p>
 <p> My favorite drink is coffee. I can enjoy it at any point of the day. 
    This past weekend I went to my favorite local coffee shop in
    Imperial Beach called Cowabunga, and tried an iced banana latte. I had 
    never heard of banana flavored coffee before, so I was a little apprehensive, 
    but I’m so glad that I ordered it! 
    It had a natural banana flavor, not the artificial banana that I 
    was worried about. You could still taste the coffee, 
    and it wasn’t too sweet. It was PERFECT. The location is a bonus, 
    because it’s right on the beach, so I was able to enjoy my coffee 
    and a morning walk on the pier. </p>
